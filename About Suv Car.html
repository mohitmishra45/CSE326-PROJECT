    <h1>Features of SUV Car</h1>
    <p><ul>
        <li><b>Ground Clearance:</b> SUVs typically have higher ground clearance compared to sedans, making them well-suited for off-road driving and providing a commanding view of the road.</li><br>
        <li><b>All-Wheel Drive (AWD) or Four-Wheel Drive (4WD):</b> Many SUVs come equipped with AWD or 4WD systems, enhancing traction and stability in various driving conditions, including snow, mud, or uneven terrain.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Spacious Interiors:</b> SUVs often have ample interior space, offering comfortable seating for passengers and cargo. Some models have third-row seating to accommodate larger groups.</li>
        <br>
        <li> <b>Space:</b> SUVs are designed with a focus on cargo space, with rear seats that can often be folded down to create a larger cargo area for transporting bulky items.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Towing Capacity:</b> Many SUVs are capable of towing trailers or other recreational vehicles, making them suitable for outdoor activities like camping, boating, or towing trailers.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Safety Features:</b> SUVs often come equipped with advanced safety features, including multiple airbags, anti-lock brakes, stability control systems, and more. Some models may also include advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) such as collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and lane departure warning.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Infotainment Systems:</b> Modern SUVs usually come with advanced infotainment systems that include touchscreen displays, smartphone integration (such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), Bluetooth connectivity, and navigation systems.</li>

        <br>
        <li><b>Fuel Efficiency:</b> While traditionally not as fuel-efficient as smaller vehicles, many newer SUV models are designed with improved fuel efficiency, incorporating technologies such as hybrid or electric powertrains.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Off-Road Capabilities:</b> Some SUVs are specifically designed for off-road adventures, featuring off-road tires, skid plates, and specialized suspension systems to handle rough terrain.</li>
