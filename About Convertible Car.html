    <h1>Features Of Convertible Car's</h1>
    <div class="features">
    <p>
        <ul>
<li><b>Retractable Roof:</b>The defining feature of a convertible is its retractable roof. This can be a soft top made of fabric or a hard top made of materials like metal or composite. 
</li><br>
<li><b>Convertible Mechanism:</b>Convertibles can have different mechanisms for lowering and raising the roof. Common types include manual (hand-operated) systems, semi-automatic systems (partially manual and partially automatic), and fully automatic systems (usually motorized).
</li><br>
<li><b>Hardtop Convertibles:</b>Some convertibles have hardtop roofs that provide better insulation, security, and a quieter cabin when the top is up. These hardtops are often power-operated for ease of use.
</li><br>
<li><b>Soft Top Convertibles:</b>Soft tops are typically made of fabric and can be folded down manually or automatically. Soft tops are lighter and often more compact, allowing for greater trunk space when the top is down.
</li><br>
<li><b>All-Season Functionality:</b>Many modern convertibles are designed to be used in all seasons. They have features like heated seats, advanced climate control systems, and wind deflectors to enhance comfort when driving with the top down in cooler weather.
</li><br>
<li><b>Wind Deflectors:</b>To reduce wind turbulence and noise when driving with the top down, some convertibles are equipped with wind deflectors. These can be integrated into the design or added as accessories.
</li><br>
<li><b>Convertible-specific Design:</b>Convertibles may have specific design elements, such as reinforced structures and chassis to compensate for the lack of a fixed roof. This is done to maintain structural integrity and safety.
</li><br>
<li><b>Performance Features:</b>Some convertibles, especially sports-oriented models, may come with performance enhancements like sport-tuned suspension, powerful engines, and other features to enhance the driving experience.
</li><br>
<li><b>Convertible Top Operation at Speed:</b>Some convertible models allow for the operation of the convertible top while the car is in motion, often at low speeds. This feature adds convenience when changing the car's configuration on the go.
</li><br>
<li><b>Technology Integration:</b>Modern convertibles often come equipped with advanced technology features such as touchscreen infotainment systems, navigation, smartphone connectivity, and driver assistance systems.
</li><br>
<li><b>Safety Features:</b>Convertibles are designed with safety in mind. They may have roll bars or other safety features to protect occupants in the event of a rollover.
</li><br>
<li><b>Customization Options:</b>Some convertible models offer customization options for the appearance of the roof, interior, and exterior, allowing owners to personalize their vehicles.
